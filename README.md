# Gambling on Campus - Data Collection & Analysis 

Student reporters from the Shirley Povich Center for Sports Journalism and Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland worked on a four-month investigation looking into [sports betting on college campuses](https://cnsmaryland.org/gambling-on-campus) in the United States. 

We found that only [23% of schools had published sports betting policies](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/02/27/sports-betting-grows-on-campuses-with-few-restrictions-survey-finds/), out of the 145 Division I public universities in the states where sports betting is legal that both centers reached out to. 

## Methodology

Each student reporter was assigned to a number of public colleges to reach out to and ask for their sports betting policies. Reporters would read a policy to see if sports betting was allowed on campus, where it was allowed, who was allowed to do it, and so on. I created a Google Poll with general survey questions pertaining to information about these policies. I also created a key/dictionary that described what the questions meant for the reporters to understand. The reporters would fill it out and their answers would be saved to a sheet. I kept track of their results and updated the poll based on reporters requests. I finally conducted analysis on the results in R, which gave us our main finding. 

**_NOTE: As a team, we considered pulling in college debt data from the U.S. Department of Education. I conducted analysis on this to see which schools allowed betting and had a significant amount of debt. The analysis and code is still in the R notebook, but was eventually not used in the final stories of the investigation._**
